## 🛑 Disclaimer

The original code for this project was created with the help of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) to help me jumpstart my learning journey. I modified the comments and explored how the code works to build familiarity with Python before starting the **Cisco Python Essentials** course.

This project is **purely educational** and was designed to help me get hands-on exposure to:
- Writing and running Python scripts
- Understanding syntax and basic logic
- Learning how to work with files, dates, and functions
- Practicing good GitHub practices (commits, README, documentation)

I'm sharing this publicly to showcase my learning progress, not as an original or advanced work. 💡✨
